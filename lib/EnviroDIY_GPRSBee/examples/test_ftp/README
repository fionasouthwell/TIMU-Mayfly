This example demonstrates a FTP file upload using the GPRSbee.

Before you can run this example you must fill in the FTP server
parameters. Hostname, username and password, and the directory
path on the FTP server. Futhermore you need to fill in the APN
of your mobile service.

The example is not optimized at all. It only shows the basic steps
to upload a file.

Please be aware that the SODAQ Moja board uses the RX/TX of the
Atmel MCU which is also used by the USB connection to upload
your program to the MCU. The GPRSbee does not work if the USB
port remains connected. So, upload the program and then disconnect
the USB.
