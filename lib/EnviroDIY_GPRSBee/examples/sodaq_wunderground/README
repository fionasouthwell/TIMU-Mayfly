This is an example to upload data to the Weather Underground. The code
is purely for educational purpose. No guarantee that it is 100% correct.

Required libraries:

 * Sodaq_BMP085 ( http://downloads.sodaq.net/Sodaq_BMP085.zip )
 * Sodaq_SHT2x ( http://downloads.sodaq.net/Sodaq_SHT2x.zip )
 * Sodaq_DS3231 ( http://downloads.sodaq.net/Sodaq_DS3231.zip )
 * RTCTimer ( http://downloads.sodaq.net/RTCTimer.zip )

Latest source code of these libraries can be found in our Github,

After you build the code and upload it to a SODAQ board the program will
start by reading the wunderground parameters. Without filling in the
required login details the program will loop until the parameters are
filled in.

The configuration parameters are stored in EEPROM.

The configuration dialog looks like this:

SODAQ wunderground

Settings:
  sample interval (b=): 1800
  sync RTC (rtc=): 86400
  station name (nm=): wunderground
  APN (apn=):
  PWS server (srv=): weatherstation.wunderground.com
  PWS id (id=):
  PWS password (pw=):
Enter command:

After the parameters are entered you can enter "ok" to start the program.
Otherwise it will continue after a 20 second timeout. (And, of course the
required parameters must have been entered.)

The example is also setup to output diagnostice messages to a Software Serial
at D4/D5.

Notice that you are encouraged to look at the source code of the sketch. The
sketch is programmed to read the temperature and air pressure from a BMP085.
You'll need to connect one to get any useful values for the upload. Better
still you should connect your own sensors and modify the sketch to upload
that data.

A word of caution about the length of the URL for Weather Underground. The
GPRSbee (i.e. SIM900) has a limited url length. It isn't documented but
probably it is somewhere between 200 and 256.

Happy coding
